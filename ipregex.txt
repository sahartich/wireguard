I just always find myself using my IP validation regex, but I constantly  recreate it lol, it is very useful...

(\w+)(?=\:\sflags.*\n.*inet ())

([1-9]\d?|1\d{1,2}|2([0-4]\d?|5[0-5]))(\.(0|([1-9]\d?|1\d{1,2}|2([0-4]\d?|5[0-5])))){3}(?=\s) 

the negative lookahead (?=\s) should be changed depending on use (for instance, IP might need to be end of line, or followed by dot, cidr range etc)
currently it is only matching if followed by a whitespace
